# MemXTerminator

A software for membrane analysis and subtraction in cryo-EM.

![overview](./doc/img/0-1.png)

## Overview

This software utilizes 2D averages and their corresponding alignment information, employing methods such as Radon transformation, cross-correlation, L1 norm, Bezier curves, Monte Carlo simulations, and genetic algorithms. It analyzes and subtracts membranes of any shape in cryo-EM, ultimately producing particle stacks and micrographs with membrane signals removed, suitable for subsequent membrane protein analysis.

## Features

* Capable of analyzing biological membranes of any shape, including simple lines and arcs, as well as more complex shapes like S or W curves;
* Accurately locates and subtracts biological membrane signals;
* Utilizes GPU and CUDA acceleration to enhance computational speed;
* Features a user-friendly GUI for ease of use.

## Requirements

* This software requires a GPU and CUDA acceleration, necessitating the installation of CUDA drivers and libraries, as well as the cupy library.
* In some cases, [pyem](https://github.com/asarnow/pyem) is also needed to convert cryoSPARC’s `.cs` files to Relion’s `.star` format for processing.
