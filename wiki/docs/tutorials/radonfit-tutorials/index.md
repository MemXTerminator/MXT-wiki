# Membrane Subtraction Workflow Using Radonfit

## Method Introduction

This method primarily uses Radon transformation and cross-correlation to fit 2D averages with **simple lines and arcs as models**, obtaining functional expressions that include information such as the membrane center, angle, and curvature. It is suitable for **simpler biological membrane models**, such as viral envelopes.
